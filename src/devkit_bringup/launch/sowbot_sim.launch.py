sowbot_sim.launch.py
====================
Gazebo sim layer for the Sowbot — launched from the UI System tab.

Starts: Gazebo (gz sim), robot_state_publisher, spawn agro_robot,
        ros_gz_bridge, Nav2.

Does NOT start: topo nav, UI node.  Those run in sim_nav.launch.py
which manage.py starts at container boot.

Nav2 lives here (not in sim_nav.launch.py) so that it only ever
initialises after /clock is already being published by ros_gz_bridge.
This guarantees use_sim_time=True works correctly from the start — no
fake clock source, no race condition.

Startup sequence inside this file
----------------------------------
1. preflight_pkill  — kills any stale parameter_bridge from a previous run
2. sim_launch       — gz sim + robot_state_publisher + spawn + ros_gz_bridge
                      (ros_gz_bridge starts 2s after spawn exits, per sim.launch.py)
3. nav2 (t+15s)     — Nav2 server nodes with use_sim_time=True; by this point
                      /clock is live from the bridge and TF frames carry
                      Gazebo sim-time stamps, so all TF lookups succeed
4. nav2_lifecycle (t+20s) — lifecycle_manager_navigation, started 5s AFTER
                      the Nav2 nodes above so it never races their process
                      startup (previously both started in the same
                      TimerAction batch; under load this could leave
                      bt_navigator configured but never activated)
5. bridge_watchdog  — revives parameter_bridge if it dies (e.g. gz restart)

Nav2 node helpers (_nav2_sim_nodes, _topo_nav_nodes) are kept here so
that any future callers can import them via importlib if needed.

Robot model:
  Spawns urdf:=sowbot_01.xacro (Amiga-NG primitive geometry) by default.

Topo map:
  Set TMAP2_FILE env var to override. Defaults to mixed_actions_map.yaml
  from the topological_navigation share directory (the upstream demo map).

collision_monitor: omitted — Nav2 Jazzy crashes before lifecycle if no
  sensor is declared. Re-enable once confirmed working.
